📊 Emissions Formula
GHG Emissions (kg CO₂e) = Total Usage (kWh) × 0.45

We use a fixed emission factor of 0.45 kg CO₂e/kWh.

📌 Assumptions & Design Decisions
This app is designed for individual or facility energy tracking.

Entries are stored monthly; no login system is required.

Used simple and clean UI with mobile responsiveness.

Backend uses basic CORS and JSON middleware.

GHG emissions are calculated server-side for consistency.

🚀 Future Enhancements
📈 Add charts for month-on-month comparison

🔐 Add user authentication and user-specific data

🌍 Support for regional emission factors

💾 Export to CSV or Excel

📱 Fully responsive mobile-first redesign
